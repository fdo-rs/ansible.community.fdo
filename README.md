# Ansible Community FDO Collection

FDO solves a problem for building a chain of trust through managed infrastructure within an organization. Specifically, FDO solves:

- A problem of trust chain of the infrastructure.
- FDO takes care of the authentication and registration process of a new device.
- FDO authenticates/authorizes requests before enrolling and passing configuration to the existing devices.
- There should be a secure channel for all the commands being issued to the device and between devices and FDO backend server.
